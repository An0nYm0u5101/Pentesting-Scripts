## InSpy

A python based LinkedIn employee enumerator. This script is great for social engineering assessments where clients ask one
to provide employee emails.

## EasyScope
-----

This script was made to assist with expanding and compressing arbitrary ip addresses. This script was born after having multiple clients supply me with abnormal IP ranges/cidrs.

### Help

```
EasyScope by Jonathan Broche (@g0jhonny)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -r RANGE RANGE, --range RANGE RANGE
                        A set of two IPs
  -f FILE, --file FILE  File containing one subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.1/24) or
                        IP range (e.g. 192.168.1.1-192.168.1.254) per line.
  -e, --expand          Expand IPs
  -c, --compress        Compress IPs/CIDRs
  -o OUTFILE, --outfile OUTFILE
                        File to write results to.
```
### Examples
