# Pentesting-Scripts

A collection of scripts I use on pentests. Hopefully they can be of use to you as well! Update: [InSpy](https://github.com/gojhonny/InSpy) has been moved to its own repo.

## EasyScope
-----

This script will take an IP address range or a list of addresses/ranges and either
expand them into single IPs or combine them into a supernet. Very useful for those
abnormal scopes.
