# Pentesting-Scripts

A collection of scripts I use on pentests. Hopefully they can be of use to you as well!

* [Domino Effect](https://github.com/gojhonny/Pentesting-Scripts/#domino-effect)
* [EasyScope](https://github.com/gojhonny/Pentesting-Scripts/#easyscope)

## Domino Effect
-----
Domino effect exploits an IBM Domino Database Security Bypass vulnerability, [CVE-2002-0664](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2002-0664), to extract password hashes from the *names.nsf* database. Domino effect obtains password hashes from hidden HTML *HTTPPassword* and *dspHTTPPassword* fields and outputs them to stdout in multiple formats for use with hashcat and/or john the ripper.

This script was inspired by @maudits's [fetchDomino](https://github.com/maudits/fetchDomino)

### Help

## EasyScope
-----

This script will take an IP address range or a list of addresses/ranges and either
expand them into single IPs or combine them into a supernet. Very useful for those
abnormal scopes.

### Help

```
EasyScope by Jonathan Broche (@g0jhonny)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -r RANGE RANGE, --range RANGE RANGE

  -f FILE, --file FILE  File containing one subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.1/24) or
                        IP range (e.g. 192.168.1.1-192.168.1.254) per line
  -o OUTFILE, --outfile OUTFILE
                        File to write results to
  -e, --expand          Expand IP adddresses/ranges into single IP addresses
