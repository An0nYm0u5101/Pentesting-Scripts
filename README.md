## EasyScope
-----

This script will take an IP address range or a list of addresses/ranges and either
expand them into single IPs or combine them into a supernet. Very useful for those
abnormal scopes.

  -f FILE, --file FILE  File containing one subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.1/24) or
                        IP range (e.g. 192.168.1.1-192.168.1.254) per line
  -o OUTFILE, --outfile OUTFILE
                        File to write results to
  -e, --expand          Expand IP adddresses/ranges into single IP addresses
