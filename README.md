# Pentesting-Scripts

A collection of scripts I use on pentests. Hopefully they can be of use to you as well!

## InSpy
-----

A python based LinkedIn employee enumerator. This script is great for social engineering assessments where clients ask one
to provide employee emails.

### Help

```
InSpy enumerates a list of current employees from any company by querying LinkedIn

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c COMPANY, --company COMPANY
                        Company name
  -d [DEPT], --dept [DEPT]
                        Department or title to query employees against. Inspy
                        searches through a predefined list by default.
  -e EMAILFORMAT, --emailformat EMAILFORMAT
                        Email output format. Acceptable formats:
                        first.last@xyz.com, last.first@xyz.com, flast@xyz.com,
                        lastf@xyz.com
  -i [INPUTFILENAME], --inputfilename [INPUTFILENAME]
                        File with list of departments or titles to query
                        employees against (one item per line)
  -o [OUTFILENAME], --outfilename [OUTFILENAME]
                        Output results to text file
```
